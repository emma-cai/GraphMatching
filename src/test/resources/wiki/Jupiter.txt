Jupiter, the fifth planet from the sun, is the largest planet in the solar system.
It is the first of the gas giants and has no surface, though it may have a rocky core.
Although it is only 1/1000th as massive as the sun, it is more than twice as massive as all of the other planets in the solar system combined.
Jupiter's atmosphere is separated into different bands and gives the planet the appearance of having whitish and reddish layers with various spots, swirls and bubbles.
Jupiter's most notable feature, other than its size, is the great red spot, a football shaped area of intense storms.
Three Earths could fit inside the great red spot.
The spot, which is a high pressure, stable storm with winds that gust over 400 miles per hour, is said to be somewhat similar to a hurricane.
Recent studies have shown that the spot has actually shrunk and that the storm may be weakening.
Scientists still don't have an explanation for why the spot looks red.
