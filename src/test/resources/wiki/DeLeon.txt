After making several stops at Caribbean islands, de Leon and his men reached the east coast of Florida (St. Augustine) on April 2, 1513.
He named the land Pascua de Florida, or Feast of Flowers, because he discovered it on Palm Sunday.
He claimed all of the land for Spain.
On April 8, 1513, de Leon and his men left northern Florida and sailed south along the Gulf Stream.
After a fight between his men and natives in southern Florida, he sailed to Cuba.
He tried to sail back to Bimini, but could not find it.
De Leon soon returned to Puerto Rico where he sacked a rebellion of natives against Spanish rule.
After returning to Spain, he was named Captain General by the King on September 27, 1514.
De Leon did not return to the New World until 1521 when he once again tried to find the island of Bimini.
Instead, de Leon and his men landed on the gulf coast of Florida, where they were met by hostile Indians who shot his men with arrows.
De Leon himself was wounded and died a short time after sailing to Havana, Cuba in July of 1521.
