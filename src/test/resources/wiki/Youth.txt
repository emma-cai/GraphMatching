Juan Ponce de Leon was born in 1460 in Santeveras, Spain.
De Leon was an explorer and fighter from an early age.
He helped fight the Muslims in southern Spain in the early 1490's.
He was on board Christopher Columbus' second expedition to the Americas in 1493.
Rather than returning to Spain, the adventurer remained at an island called Santo Domingo (now called the Dominican Republic).
De Leon was soon appointed as the governor of the Higuey region of Santo Domingo.
Like many Spanish explorers, he was blood thirsty for gold.
When he heard rumors that a nearby island called Borinquen (now Puerto Rico) was full of gold, he invaded the island and brutally conquered the natives.
He was soon appointed governor of the island, but lost his title in 1511 because of his extreme brutality toward the natives.
De Leon's misfortunes as governor did not stop him from looking for gold and the Fountain of Youth.
During his search, he conquered many islands, including Bimini.
After returning to Puerto Rico, de Leon took three ships and 200 men on a mission to explore lands to the north.
De Leon hoped to find the Fountain of Youth, a mythical spring that was said to make anyone who drank its water young forever.
