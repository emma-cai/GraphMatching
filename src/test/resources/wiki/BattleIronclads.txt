The Battle of the Ironclads, also known as the Battle of Hampton Roads, was likely the most important naval battle of the American Civil War.
On March 8-9, 1862, Confederate forces attempted to break a powerful Union naval blockade that had isolated Norfolk and Richmond from international trade by deploying their ironclad warship, the CSS Virginia, which was originally the USS Merrimac.
After the secession of the southern states, the Confederacy had gained control of the Gosport Navy Yard and all of its ships formerly under Union control.
Nevertheless, Union naval forces remained in control of several forts in the region and staged a powerful blockade that the Confederacy was initially powerless to break.
Because of the Union's naval and industrial superiority, Confederate engineers were forced to think of new ways to combat the Union advantage.
The world's first ironclad ship had set sail in France in 1860 and Southern engineers believed they could duplicate the idea.
Work began in 1861 on the Merrimac, which had been partially destroyed, and which was recently raised from the bed of the Elizabeth River.
The plan was to build an iron shell around the ship and to outfit it with an iron ram.
It took seven months to complete.
When it was done, the armor encasing the Virginia was two inches thick backed by two feet of iron and pine.
It was equipped with ten guns and fourteen gun ports and was ready for action by February of 1862.
