Technology shocks are events in a macroeconomic model, that change the production function.
The term shock is defined as a sudden change in economic terms.
Usually this is modeled with an aggregate production function that has a scaling factor.
A technology shock is when there is a sudden change in technology to either benefit or worsen economic activity.
This type of shock has big effects on companies that are solely dependent on technology as their main source of labor or production, such as manufacturing plants or oil/energy extraction.
A technology shock affects an industry or firm's productivity, this may be a positive shock—increasing the output for a given set of inputs, or a negative shock—decreasing the output for a given set of inputs.
Negative shocks are much less common than positive shocks as technology rarely moves backwards.
The Industrial Revolution is an example of a positive technology shock.
The Industrial Revolution occurred between the 18th and the 19th centuries where major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transport, and technology occurred.
What this did to the economy at the time was notable.
It increased wages steadily over the period of time and it also increased population because people had the wages for standard living.
This is an example of a positive technology shock, where it increases national and disposable income, and also increases the labor force.
The Industrial Revolution also provided a much more efficient way to produce goods which lead to less labor-intensive work.
The oil shocks that occurred in the late 1970s are examples of negative technology shocks.
When the oil shocks occurred, the energy that was used to extract to oil became more expensive, the energy was the technology in this case.
The price of the capital and the labor both went up due to this shock, and this is an example of a negative technology shock.
Real business cycle theory (RBCT) is the theory where any type of shock has a ripple effect into many other shocks.
To relate this to current times the upward price on oil is a RBCT because of the negative technology shock that happened due to the raise in price for the process of extracting of the oil.
Now due to this increase in price for energy to extract the oil, fewer people could afford oil which drove economic activity down and at the same time lessens a countries national GDP.
Typically, a RBCT starts with a negative type of shock, which is why the RBCT is becoming less and less relevant in today's economics.
More and more economists are arguing against the RBCT because very rarely can you have a negative shock on technology with the amount of advancements we are going through now.
A supply shock is an event that suddenly changes the price of a commodity or service.
It may be caused by a sudden increase or decrease in the supply of a particular good.
This sudden change affects the equilibrium price.
A negative supply shock (sudden supply decrease) will raise prices and shift the aggregate supply curve to the left.
A negative supply shock can cause stagflation due to a combination of raising prices and falling output.
A positive supply shock (an increase in supply) will lower the price of said good and shift the aggregate supply curve to the right.
A positive supply shock could be an advance in technology (a technology shock) which makes production more efficient, thus increasing output.
In economics, a demand shock is a sudden event that increases or decreases demand for goods or services temporarily.
