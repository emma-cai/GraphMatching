Plants grow almost everywhere on our planet.
Plants need the same things to live.
The four things plants need are light, water, air, and soil.
The roots are underground.
This is the part of the plant that takes in water and nutrients from the soil.
The stem connects the roots with the leaves.
The trunk of a tree is a good example of this part of a plant.
This part carries water and nutrients from the roots to other parts of the plant.
The leaves are the parts of the plant that grow out of the stem.
They take in nutrients and light.
